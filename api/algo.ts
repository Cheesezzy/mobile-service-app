/* 
To write an efficient algorithm for searching and filtering businesses by proximity or ranking in JavaScript, you could use a combination of two data structures: a hash map and a priority queue (or heap).

The hash map would be used to store the businesses and their locations, using the business name or ID as the key and the location (represented as a latitude and longitude pair) as the value. This would allow for fast lookup of the location of a given business.

The priority queue would be used to store the businesses in order of proximity or ranking. To implement this, you would need to define a comparator function that takes two businesses and returns a value indicating which one is closer (or has a higher ranking) than the other. This comparator function would be passed to the priority queue when it is created, and the priority queue would use it to determine the order in which the businesses are stored.

Once you have these data structures in place, the search and filter algorithm would work as follows:

    *The user enters a search query and specifies a filter (by proximity or ranking).
    *The algorithm uses the search query to look up the location of the user (if searching by proximity) or the ranking of the businesses (if searching by ranking) using the hash map.
    *The algorithm adds the businesses to the priority queue, using the comparator function to determine the order in which they are added.
    *The algorithm retrieves the businesses from the priority queue and returns them to the user, starting with the closest (or highest ranking) business and working down the list.
